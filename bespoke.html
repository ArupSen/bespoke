<p class="heading"><strong>Bespoke</strong></p>
<p class="intro">Every client's requirements are unique. Some have a very precise idea of the piece they want to have made, Others need to start at the beginning and first consider how and when it is to be worn. Often this will dictate which stones we use.</p>
<p class="intro">We then discuss a budget and I will choose a selection of stones for you to peruse. Depending on how rare the type of stone, it may be one of a kind, or you may have several stones to select from. Remember each gem has its own characteristics and there will be one which seems to be just made for you. We then spend as long as you need designing how the stones will be set to reflect your personal style and budget.</p>

    <p>I loved helping Alyson and Simon to create their perfect engagement ring, they had a very strong design aesthetic and I encouraged them to primarily focus on choosing the perfect stone. We considered yellow and blue Diamonds, all colours of Sapphires and Spinels, settling on the most amazing 11.26ct natural french lemon Sapphire (with a Gem-A lab report) set in a really simple 18ct yellow gold setting.</p>

<div class="jewelRight">
    <p>A fantastically subtle colour combination which can be worn for day, whilst still being special enough to glitter beautifully at night time. Two pink Kunzite gems (7.13cts) and a perfect set of pale green Prasiolite drops (17.09cts) have been placed in an 18ct white gold frame with minimal metal to enhance the the beauty of the stones. These earrings can be recreated in other colour combinations.</p>

    <p>Many years ago I purchased this 14ct cabochon Emerald and finally this year I decided to create a pendant. The setting is hand made and the rich 18ct yellow gold feels luxurious. Pairing it with a 5.35ct oval cabochon Tanzanite, rather than using Diamonds enables this piece to be worn for all occasions. I can make similar pendants with any combination of stones....however this piece is for sale should you be tempted!</p>

<div class="jewelRight">
    <p>The horse shoe shaped Diamond brooch came into my family in the late 1800's, I inherited it at 18 years of age, and as brooch wearing is not so in fashion and I found that it rarely had an outing. I purchased an antique chain and had it set mid-centre and viola a new diamond pendant for me to enjoy. Have a think if you have any old brooches collecting dust?</p>

    <p>An existing client recommended a friend of hers who had a negative experience of remodelling some jewellery in the past, therefore we took the process very slowly. Her original ring was in a wiry 70's setting and she had not worn it for a long time. I think the photo shows how amazing the ring looks now and I am delighted to say she immediately asked me to work on the design for a pendant using stones from two of her rings.</p>
    <hr />

<div class="jewelRight">
    <p>Spinels are fantastic stones and this one is such a unique purple colour. During its time in my home it had many admirers and there are several who mourn the lost opportunity to own it! However, the good news is that it was snapped up by my lovely cousin who desired a ring which was modern and classic and I think the square Diamonds perfectly frame the 10mm round (4.59ct) Spinel to create such a ring.</p>

    <p>I opened my post one morning and out dropped a well loved tear sheet from a magazine. The picture sent from Ireland was of a coveted pair of earrings. Already the proud owner of the gorgeous ruby and diamond ring (on my website) Sinead was confident to start the ball rolling from afar. Set in 18ct white gold the eight Diamonds weighing a total of approx .64 pts are perfectly balanced with 10mm pear shaped fresh water pearl drops.</p>

<div class="jewelRight">
    <p>All my rings are hand made, however this one is a work of art. My client brought me a hugely sentimental and beautiful old cut 2 ct Diamond which she wanted to be set in a modern but timeless design. By surrounding the Diamond with two rows of bespoke cut perfectly matched blue baguette Sapphire's we managed to create a cocktail ring which is jaw dropping but still delicate enough to be extremely comfortable to wear.</p>

    <p>A unique untreated 14.58 ct oval cushion cut Lemon Sapphire set in 18ct yellow and white gold with perfectly proportioned diamonds to show the Sapphire at its sparkly best. A once in a life time ring which one amazing husband took the time to design for his very lucky wife! 
</p>

<div class="jewelRight">
    <p>The brief was 'make me a big funky lunch ring'. We did by designing the unheard of combination of a bezel setting a 5ct pink sapphire in 18ct rose gold with two rough cut slices of Watermelon Tourmaline showing their concentric rings of pink and green which perfectly match the sapphires' gorgeous colour.

    <img src="octagonal.jpg" alt="" />
    <p>All clients are individual, however this Aussie only liked the colour copper and wore absolutely no jewellery at all, ever!  However when proposed to it all had to change...and if you could see this ring on her finger you would know there could be no other!  A dark green Octagonal 4.11 ct Sapphire supported by two light green oval cut Sapphires weighing 4.86cts in gorgeous 18ct Rose Gold. Totally a one off.

<div class="jewelRight">
    <p>An extremely wearable and modern dark blue Sapphire and Diamond Baguette 18ct yellow gold ring. Smooth to touch with a very comfortable graduated band makes it the perfect ring to enjoy everyday.

<div class="jewelLeft">
    <img src="peridot.jpg" alt="" />
    <p>Years of yearning for the perfect green Peridot ring, lead to an extensive search for the right one!  Once we found the 8.5ct oval cushion cut stone all we did was place a few diamonds on the shoulders and let the beautiful stone speak for itself.
</p>

<div class="jewelRight">
    <p>An unusual request from a client who describes herself as 'not a big jewellery wearer' to set a rather impressive 2.2ct Brilliant cut Diamond in as simple a setting as possible.  To find the solution we enjoyed shopping together to really help choose the best setting for her, the result is the perfect modern and simple bezel set Platinum Solitaire.

    <img src="ruby_cocktail.jpg" alt="" />
    <p>My brief was to make a Ruby cocktail ring. My client had the brilliant cut diamonds and I sourced a selection of Rubies to choose from. This one weighs 3.35cts and is the true red of a good South East Asian ruby. We set the ring in Platinum with Baguettes Diamonds to give the ring a more contemporary feel, an important piece for a serious jewellery collector.

    <p>A special ring made with blue sapphires and diamonds in 18ct yellow gold to remember a promise made by my friend to her mother. Her mother wanted to know what she was going to spend a gift of some money on and she said a ring made with blue stones as they are your favourite colour.
</p>

<div class="jewelRight">
    <p>A unique pendant made from a flawless 25ct peridot and a 6 ct spessartite garnet.  the setting is hand made to use the minimum about of gold, allowing the stones to speak for themselves. The 18ct yellow gold cable was made to match the piece.

</div><!-- end .jewelRight -->

<div class="jewelLeft">
    <img src="pear_drops.jpg" alt="" />
    <p>Having sourced a complete set of four matching peridot, we used the two pear drops to make earrings to compliment the pendant.  It was very difficult to find the perfect pear shaped spessartites to match, so we found the best colour and approximate shape and had the stones cut to create the perfect balance to the drop. Once again all of the settings have been hand made to show minimal gold support.
